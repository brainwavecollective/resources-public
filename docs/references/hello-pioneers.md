# AI Pioneers - Intro to Modern Robotics 

A lot came up during our discussions so I thought I'd put together some quick references. If you have any questions or think of something I missed don't hesitate to reach out so I can update this reference.

I had a blast discussing all of the things, thank you for the opportunity!

The approachable open source robots that we covered are from Hugging Face. [Reachy Mini](https://pollen-robotics.com/reachy-mini/), [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) (featuring the SO-101 robot arm), and [Microduck](https://pollen-robotics.com/microduck/).

## Robot Links & Videos 
  
[2019-2026 Progression of Robots](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CxI18jiy4S4)
A side-by-side comparison of Boston Dynamics humanoids over the last 7 years. The more advanced training was accomplished through RL (Reinforcement Learning) 
  
[RL explained by ducks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3evPHMl0aI)
Fun video explaining RL, with microducks. This is actual training data visualized, using the sim environment that ships with the duck

You can [run the actual Microduck RL Simulation training fairly easily](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl). You will need at least a decently powerful laptop, of course a full GPU server is best. If anyone wants to explore more with this please let me know.

Jensen Huang [closed GTC Berlin featuring microducks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt6d62vN7CU). Pollen Robotics was acquired by Hugging Face last year, and this summer Hugging Face was acquired by NVIDIA.

A similar MuJoCo sim environment exists for the **Reachy Mini**. You can find more info in the [Reachy Mini simulation guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/reachy_mini/en/platforms/simulation/get_started).

Althogh most any robot can be ported to a sim environment, **LeRobot**'s broader focus means there are already many more options available, including: LIBERO, LeIsaac (NVIDIA Isaac Lab), Meta-World, and Gym-Style Tasks. There are also 3rd party integrations with WASM MuJoCo Web Demos, LeHome, and gym-so100-c. You can find more info in the [LeRobot GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).

## Building apps for robots
  
We talked about [Clem's Reachy Mini receptionist built in 2 hours](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clementdelangue_receptionist-robotics-app-built-under-2-hours-ugcPost-7456093115226144768-o7DN/). You can see [Clem's entire prompting process](https://huggingface.co/datasets/clem/ml-intern-sessions/blob/main/sessions/2026-05-01/5eb4110b-756c-428a-88e5-17baef6074a7.jsonl) as well as [a video of the receptionst in action](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clementdelangue_receptionist-robotics-app-built-under-2-hours-ugcPost-7456093115226144768-o7DN/). 
  
We talked about [using Reachy Mini to keep you off your phone](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcodomingo_nvidiagtc-edgeai-physicalai-ugcPost-7426591940986589184-o8xT/). 

Regarding the medical environment monitoring use case, I mentioned the Relate Anything Project which is [recent research on models that can understand action states of individual objects in realtime](https://maelic.github.io/RelateAnythingProject/).

## Spatial / 3D worlds
While World Labs isn't the only way to get a 3D world, here is my [digital capture of ID345](https://marble.worldlabs.ai/world/9142dbc2-0554-4274-8e32-d59976a2f66a). I used the camera of the Reachy Mini to take 45 pictures, and stitched them together in post. Use of the robot isn't necessary, and here's [a random youtuber's experience using 8 phone photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3d7pj6y5tc). There are many ways to get these outcomes.

I did not show a related video, but we talked about [use of World Labs for set design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yqZcE5m3s0). Marble is also the model that generated the worlds above.

Not disucssed, but one of my favorite videos showcasing where this is going, is a [video of Dr. Fei Fei Li folding laundry](https://x.com/drfeifei/status/2094883331959894498) where we see control of time and space, and the speed of the video is controlled along with the location of the camera during a video. I believe this was created with 4 sync'd camera feeds using the new Atlas model that I just got access to.

More recently Google's Gemini 4 Argon has some insane capabilities. Here's just one video showcasing a use with [Antigravity agentic loops and Argon to build complex worlds through Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dAcJEIlQM8). There's also this [cornhole video where a robot uses RL to train itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PICEmtfpWU) (again, MuJoCo simulation, same sim environment for microducks).

## Purchasing Robots 

Although you can [purchase Reachy Mini directly from Hugging Face/Pollen Robotics](https://pollen-robotics.com/reachy-mini/), I also have a handful available. [Email me](mailto:daniel@brainwavecollective.ai) if you are interested. 

For LeRobot SO-101 arms I have 3D printed kits, motors, and other parts available if you don't want to source the BOM/print yourself.

Microduck is currently [pre-order](https://pollen-robotics.com/microduck/) and is expected to ship early next year.
